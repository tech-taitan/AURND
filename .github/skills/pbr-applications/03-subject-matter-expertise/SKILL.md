# Subject Matter Expertise — Skill Definition

## Purpose

Enable the practitioner to understand both the tax law framework and the industry context sufficiently to draft a technically accurate and credible PBR application.

## Why Combined

Tax law knowledge and domain knowledge are artificially separated in practice. In reality:

- **Legal tests reference industry concepts** — you can't apply them without understanding
- **Cases turn on factual distinctions** — understanding requires domain knowledge
- **Credibility requires fluency** — using correct terminology signals competence
- **Client communication depends on understanding** — you must speak their language

This skill domain reflects that **knowing the law and knowing the industry are one integrated competency**.

## Level 2: Core Tax Law

### Why Important

Every PBR is grounded in statutory provisions. Misunderstanding the law leads to:
- Asking questions the Commissioner can't answer
- Applying wrong sections to the arrangement
- Missing relevant provisions that affect outcomes

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Income Characterisation
- **Ordinary income (s.6-5)**: Income according to ordinary concepts
- **Statutory income (s.6-10)**: Income by specific provision
- **Capital vs revenue**: The fundamental distinction
- **Exempt income**: Categories excluded from assessment
- **Windfall analysis**: When receipts are neither income nor capital

**Application to gambling**:
- If business: winnings are ordinary income under s.6-5
- If hobby: winnings are mere windfall, not assessable

#### Business Definition
- **Section 995-1**: "Business" includes "any profession, trade, employment, vocation or calling"
- **Negative definition**: Does not include occupation as an employee
- **Purposive interpretation**: Business implies profit-making purpose
- **Factual determination**: Ultimately a question of fact and degree

#### Deductibility Framework
- **Section 8-1(1)**: Loss or outgoing incurred in gaining assessable income
- **Section 8-1(2)**: Exclusions (capital, private, etc.)
- **Nexus requirement**: Connection between expense and income
- **Apportionment**: Mixed purpose expenditure

**Application to gambling**:
- If business: betting losses are deductible under s.8-1
- If hobby: losses are private expenditure, not deductible

#### PBR Administration
- **Part IVA TAA 1953**: Statutory basis for rulings
- **Binding effect**: Ruling binds Commissioner for applicant
- **Scheme definition**: What the ruling covers
- **Amendment procedures**: How rulings can be varied or withdrawn

---

## Level 2: Specific Legal Tests

### Why Important

Most PBR applications involve multi-factor tests. For gambling/betting, the six-factor business test from IT 2655 and case law is determinative. Misunderstanding these factors leads to:
- Gathering wrong facts
- Making irrelevant arguments
- Missing the issues that actually matter

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### The Six-Factor Business Test

**Factor 1: Systematic, Organised, and Businesslike Manner**
- Business trappings: ABN, separate bank account, business plan
- Record-keeping: Quality and purpose of records
- Decision-making: Systematic vs intuitive/recreational
- Time and effort: Regular commitment vs sporadic

**Factor 2: Scale of Activities**
- Volume: Number of bets, frequency
- Turnover: Total amounts wagered
- Relative significance: Compared to other income sources
- *Note*: Per *Evans*, scale alone is not determinative

**Factor 3: Relationship to Other Business Activities**
- Connection: Is betting related to another business (e.g., horse training)?
- Synergies: Does other activity provide advantage in betting?
- Integration: Are activities conducted together?

**Factor 4: Profit Motive vs Pleasure**
- Primary purpose: Making money or enjoyment?
- Behavioural indicators: Would they do it if unprofitable?
- Genuine interest: Independent engagement with the subject matter
- *Key principle*: "Simple passion for gambling on a large scale... is not engaging in a business" (*Brajkovich*)

**Factor 5: Skill vs Chance**
- Skill element: Does success depend on judgment and expertise?
- Chance element: Is outcome ultimately unpredictable?
- System effectiveness: Does the method actually reduce chance?
- *Key principle*: "The mere fact that a taxpayer has a system does not mean that any pastime is converted to a business" (*Babka*)

**Factor 6: Hobby/Pastime Character**
- Ordinary perception: Would a reasonable person view this as hobby or business?
- Social context: Is the activity typically recreational?
- Personal satisfaction: Enjoyment vs pure profit-seeking

#### Applying the Test
- **Weighing factors**: No single factor is determinative
- **Overall impression**: What does the totality suggest?
- **Comparison to precedents**: How does this case compare to decided cases?

## Level 2: Industry Knowledge

### Why Important

For gambling/betting PBRs specifically, credibility requires understanding:
- How different betting activities actually work
- What tools and methods bettors use
- The distinction between recreational and sophisticated approaches

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Betting Industry Practices

**Matched Betting**
- Using bookmaker promotions to guarantee profits
- Creating offsetting positions on different platforms
- Exploiting bonus offers, free bets, refund specials

**Arbitrage Betting**
- Exploiting price differences across bookmakers
- Covering all outcomes to lock in profit
- Requires rapid execution and multiple accounts

**Value Betting**
- Identifying odds that exceed true probability
- Requires statistical modelling or expert judgment
- Long-term positive expectation despite short-term variance

**Promotions and Bonuses**
- Sign-up bonuses, reload offers, loyalty programs
- Bonus abuse and bookmaker restrictions
- "Bonus betting" as distinct from regular betting

#### Technology Landscape

**Manual Betting**
- Human decision-making for each bet
- Using apps/websites but placing bets personally
- Discretionary judgment on stake, selection, timing

**Automated Betting**
- Software that places bets without human intervention
- Algorithmic decision-making
- *Critical distinction*: PBR 1052164226424 (only business finding) involved automation

**Odds Comparison Tools**
- Software showing odds across bookmakers
- Price alerts and notifications
- Not the same as automated betting

**Data and Analysis Tools**
- Statistics databases, form guides
- Modelling software
- Subscription services

#### Terminology Fluency

Essential terms to understand and use correctly:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Bankroll | Capital allocated to betting |
| Staking plan | System for determining bet sizes |
| Edge | Advantage over the bookmaker |
| Turnover | Total amount wagered |
| ROI | Return on investment |
| Promo/bonus | Promotional offers from bookmakers |
| Gubbed/restricted | Account limited by bookmaker |
| Mug bet | Bet placed to maintain account standing |
| EV (Expected Value) | Mathematical expectation of a bet |

#### Market Patterns

**Sports vs Racing**
- Different skill/chance profiles
- Different data availability
- Different betting cultures

**Pre-match vs In-play**
- Live betting involves rapid decisions
- Pre-match allows more analysis time
- Different volatility profiles

**Exchange vs Traditional**
- Betting exchanges allow laying (betting against)
- Traditional bookmakers only allow backing
- Exchanges enable trading strategies

## Level 2: Precedent Familiarity

### Why Important

You must know the key authorities **cold**—not just find them through research, but have them ready to apply. For gambling PBRs, a small number of cases and rulings control the analysis.

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Leading Cases

***Brajkovich v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 1570**
- Facts: Systematic horse race bettor with detailed records
- Holding: Not carrying on business despite scale and system
- Key quote: "Simple passion for gambling on a large scale... is not engaging in a business"
- Significance: Established the six-factor test; emphasised hobby character can persist despite scale

***Babka v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 1251**
- Facts: Punter with detailed system and records
- Holding: Not carrying on business
- Key quote: "The mere fact that a taxpayer has a system does not mean that any pastime is converted to a business"
- Significance: System/method alone insufficient

***Evans v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 922**
- Facts: Large-scale punter
- Holding: Not carrying on business
- Key principle: Scale alone is not determinative
- Significance: Confirms scale must combine with other business characteristics

#### Key Ruling

**Taxation Ruling IT 2655**
- Subject: Whether betting and gambling can be carrying on a business
- Status: Still current despite age
- Content: Sets out six-factor test derived from case law
- Application: Primary ATO guidance for gambling business determinations

#### Published PBRs

**PBR 1052164226424** (The "business" ruling)
- Facts: Taxpayer used **automated software** that placed bets without human intervention
- Holding: **Business** — the only published gambling PBR finding business
- Significance: The automation was key; provides factual comparison point

**Hobby PBRs** (representative sample):
- 1051609866916 — manual betting, not business
- 1051857062479 — systematic approach, not business
- 1052202969499 — significant scale, not business

**Using PBRs**:
- Not binding precedent but persuasive
- Show ATO reasoning patterns
- Enable factual comparisons and distinctions

## Practical Application

### Worked Example: Applying the Six-Factor Test

| Factor | Facts | Analysis | Weighs Toward |
|--------|-------|----------|---------------|
| 1. Systematic/businesslike | No ABN, no business bank account, manual betting | Lacks business trappings | Hobby |
| 2. Scale | $500K turnover, 2,000+ bets/year | Significant but per *Evans* not determinative | Neutral |
| 3. Related business | No connection to sports industry | No business synergies | Hobby |
| 4. Profit vs pleasure | Genuine sports fan, watches regardless of betting | Recreation primary | Hobby |
| 5. Skill vs chance | Has method but outcomes still uncertain | System doesn't eliminate chance | Hobby |
| 6. Hobby character | Sports betting is typically recreational | Ordinary perception as hobby | Hobby |

**Conclusion**: Five of six factors point to hobby; scale is neutral. Overall: not carrying on business.
