# Subject Matter Expertise

## Overview

This skill domain covers the substantive knowledge required to draft a PBR application—both the technical tax law and the domain-specific knowledge of the industry or activity being ruled upon.

## Why This Skill Matters

You cannot argue what you don't understand. A PBR drafter must know:

- **Tax law**: The statutory provisions, legal tests, and precedents
- **Industry**: How the activity actually works in practice

**Poor subject matter expertise** results in:
- Misapplying legal tests to facts
- Asking the wrong questions
- Missing key authorities
- Using incorrect terminology that undermines credibility

## Scope

This skill domain encompasses:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Core Tax Law** | Statutory framework, definitions, assessment provisions |
| **Specific Legal Tests** | Multi-factor tests applicable to the ruling subject |
| **Industry Knowledge** | How the activity works in practice |
| **Precedent Familiarity** | Leading cases and rulings in the specific area |

## Why Combined

Tax knowledge and domain knowledge must integrate:

- You cannot apply the "business" definition without understanding what betting activities look like
- Industry terminology appears in cases and rulings—you must recognise it
- Client credibility depends on the drafter understanding their world
- Distinguishing cases requires understanding factual differences

## Prerequisites

Before developing this skill, ensure foundational competency in:

- General Australian tax law principles
- Legal research skills (to acquire new knowledge areas)
- Ability to learn new industries quickly

## Learning Path

1. **Start** with Core Tax Law — the framework everything hangs on
2. **Develop** Specific Legal Tests — the tests that determine outcomes
3. **Build** Industry Knowledge — understand what clients actually do
4. **Master** Precedent Familiarity — know the key authorities cold
