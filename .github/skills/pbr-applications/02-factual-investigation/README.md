# Factual Investigation & Presentation

## Overview

This skill domain covers the integrated process of gathering comprehensive facts from clients, assembling supporting evidence, drafting fact statements for the PBR application, and verifying accuracy before lodgement.

## Why This Skill Matters

The ATO's ruling is based **entirely on the facts presented**. The Commissioner:

- Cannot rule on facts not disclosed
- May request further information if facts are incomplete
- Will rule adversely if facts don't support the applicant's position

**Poor factual investigation** results in:
- Information requests causing delays (28+ day response windows)
- Adverse rulings based on incomplete picture
- Penalties if facts are later found to be false or misleading

## Scope

This skill domain encompasses:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Client Fact-Finding** | Systematic interviewing and document requests |
| **Evidence Assembly** | Collecting and organising supporting materials |
| **Fact Drafting** | Writing numbered fact statements for the application |
| **Verification & Integrity** | Ensuring accuracy before signing declarations |

## Why Combined

Gathering facts and presenting them are the **same cognitive task**:

- You draft facts as you learn them
- Drafting reveals gaps in your investigation
- The act of writing forces precision in understanding
- Verification happens throughout, not just at the end

Separating "investigation" from "presentation" creates artificial workflow breaks.

## Prerequisites

Before developing this skill, ensure foundational competency in:

- Client communication and interviewing
- Document management and organisation
- Understanding of what facts are legally relevant (requires Subject Matter Expertise)

## Learning Path

2. **Develop** Evidence Assembly — organise supporting materials
3. **Master** Fact Drafting — precise, neutral, strategic writing
4. **Refine** Verification — quality control processes
