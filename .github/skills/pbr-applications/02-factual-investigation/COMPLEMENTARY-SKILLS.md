## Direct Dependencies

Skills that **must be present** for Factual Investigation to function effectively:

### Subject Matter Expertise
**Location**: [../03-subject-matter-expertise/](../03-subject-matter-expertise/)

**Relationship**: You can't gather the right facts without knowing what facts matter:
- Legal tests define which facts are relevant
- Industry knowledge reveals what questions to ask
- Precedent familiarity shows what facts other cases turned on

**Integration point**: The six-factor business test from IT 2655 directly shapes the fact-gathering checklist categories.

### Legal Reasoning & Argumentation
**Location**: [../01-legal-reasoning/](../01-legal-reasoning/)

**Relationship**: Facts exist to support legal arguments:
- Argument gaps reveal factual gaps
- Legal framework defines fact relevance
- Strategic positioning guides fact emphasis

**Integration point**: The "Application" step in IRAC methodology consumes the facts gathered here.

## Enhancing Skills

Skills that **improve the quality** of Factual Investigation output:

### Professional Practice & Production
**Location**: [../04-professional-practice/](../04-professional-practice/)

**Relationship**: Systematic fact-gathering requires:
- Checklist management systems
- Document organisation protocols
- Version control for evolving fact sets

**Integration point**: Workflow management ensures no facts are lost between gathering and drafting.
