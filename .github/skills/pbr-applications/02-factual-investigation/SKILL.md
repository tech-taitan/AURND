# Factual Investigation & Presentation — Skill Definition

## Purpose

Enable the practitioner to gather, organise, draft, and verify comprehensive facts that support the legal arguments in a Private Binding Ruling application.

## Why Combined

Fact-finding and fact-writing are artificially separated. In practice:

- You **draft as you investigate** — writing crystallises understanding
- You **investigate as you draft** — gaps in writing reveal gaps in knowledge
- Evidence assembly **informs drafting** — what you can prove shapes what you write
- Verification **runs throughout** — not a final step but continuous process

This skill domain reflects the **iterative nature** of factual work.

## Level 2: Client Fact-Finding

### Why Important

The ATO ruling is based on facts provided. Missing facts lead to:
- Information requests (delays of 28+ days)
- Adverse inferences from gaps
- Rulings that don't address the real situation

Systematic fact-finding ensures comprehensive coverage.

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Structured Interviewing
- **Preparation**: Reviewing existing documents before client meetings
- **Open questions**: Allowing client to explain in their own words
- **Probing questions**: Following up on incomplete or unclear answers
- **Checklist discipline**: Ensuring all relevant areas are covered
- **Recording**: Documenting answers accurately (notes, recordings)

**Key areas to cover for gambling PBRs**:
- Employment and income history
- Betting history and evolution
- Methods and systems used
- Scale and frequency
- Record-keeping practices
- Business trappings (or absence)

#### Checklist Deployment
- **Using established checklists**: See `gambling_betting_business_checklist.md`
- **Adapting to context**: Modifying checklists for specific situations
- **Gap identification**: Noting areas not covered by standard questions
- **Client questionnaires**: Written instruments for systematic collection

**Example checklist categories**:
1. Purpose, intention, and overall character
2. Scale, volume, and repetition
3. System, organisation, and businesslike manner
4. Record-keeping and accounting quality
5. Skill vs chance analysis

#### Follow-Up Probing
- **Clarification requests**: When initial answers are ambiguous
- **Contradiction resolution**: When facts seem inconsistent
- **Detail extraction**: Getting specifics, not generalities
- **Timeline construction**: Establishing chronological sequence

#### Document Requests
- **Financial records**: Bank statements, betting account statements
- **Operational records**: Bet logs, spreadsheets, software outputs
- **Structural documents**: ABN records, business registrations, contracts
- **Communications**: Emails, messages showing intent and approach

---

## Level 2: Evidence Assembly

### Why Important

Facts must be **substantiated**. The application requires:
- Attachments supporting key assertions
- Evidence available if ATO requests verification
- Documentary basis for quantified facts (amounts, frequencies)

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Financial Records
- **Bank statements**: Showing deposits, withdrawals, betting transactions
- **Betting account statements**: Platform-specific records
- **Profit and loss records**: Client-prepared summaries
- **Tax returns**: Prior year positions and disclosures

**What to look for**:
- Consistency with stated betting patterns
- Scale indicators (total turnover, frequency)
- Absence of business-like features (no business account)

#### Operational Evidence
- **Screenshots**: Of betting platforms, tools, methods
- **Subscription records**: Paid services, software, data feeds
- **Bet logs**: Detailed records of individual bets
- **Method documentation**: How the client describes their approach

#### Third-Party Confirmations
- **Employment records**: Confirming income sources
- **Bookmaker correspondence**: Account restrictions, communications
- **Service provider records**: Subscriptions, memberships

#### Timeline Reconstruction
- **Chronological organisation**: When did activities start, change, scale up?
- **Key event identification**: What triggered changes in approach?
- **Contemporaneous documents**: Evidence from the time, not reconstructed

---

## Level 2: Fact Drafting

### Why Important

Facts in a PBR must be:
- **Numbered**: For easy cross-referencing in arguments
- **Neutral**: Not argumentative (that's for the Reasons section)
- **Complete**: Covering all relevant circumstances
- **Precise**: Specific, quantified where possible

Poor fact drafting undermines the entire application.

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Numbered Statements
- **Sequential numbering**: 1, 2, 3... throughout the Facts section
- **One fact per number**: Each numbered paragraph states one thing
- **Cross-referenceable**: "As noted in Fact 23..." in Reasons section

**Example**:
```markdown
28. The Applicant places bets manually through betting applications 
    on his mobile phone and computer.

29. The Applicant does not use any automated betting software that 
    places bets without human intervention.

30. Each bet is placed by the Applicant personally after he has 
    reviewed the available odds and made a decision to place the bet.
```

#### Thematic Organisation
- **Logical groupings**: Related facts together under sub-headings
- **Standard structure**:
  - A. Background and Personal Circumstances
  - B. Nature of Betting Activities
  - C. Tools and Resources Used
  - D. Scale of Activities
  - E. Financial Arrangements
  - F. Business Characteristics (or absence)
  - G. Element of Chance
  - H. Long-Term Intentions

#### Favourable Emphasis
- **Strategic selection**: Including facts that support the position
- **Neutral framing**: Stating even favourable facts objectively
- **Completeness over cherry-picking**: Comprehensive but strategic

**Example — favourable emphasis**:
> The Applicant does **not** use automated software...
> The Applicant has **never** registered for an ABN...

#### Handling Unhelpful Facts
- **Don't omit material facts**: Duty of disclosure
- **Context provision**: Explain circumstances around unhelpful facts
- **Minimisation language**: "Although X, the primary purpose..."
- **Address in Reasons**: Use Reasons section to argue why unhelpful facts aren't determinative

**Example — handling scale increase**:
> 17. In the 2025 income year, the Applicant's betting turnover increased 
>     significantly compared to prior years.
> 
> 18. This increase coincided with the Applicant ceasing full-time 
>     employment and having more time available for recreational activities.

## Level 2: Verification & Integrity

### Why Important

The applicant signs a declaration that facts are **true and complete**. False or misleading statements can result in:
- Ruling being voided
- Penalties under tax law
- Professional consequences for tax agents

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Cross-Referencing
- **Document-to-fact matching**: Each fact supported by evidence
- **Internal consistency**: Facts don't contradict each other
- **Mathematical accuracy**: Totals, percentages, averages correct

#### Source Confirmation
- **Primary sources**: Relying on original documents, not summaries
- **Client verification**: Having client confirm drafted facts
- **Third-party checks**: Verifying externally where possible

#### Anticipating Information Requests
- **ATO patterns**: What does the ATO typically ask for?
- **Gap identification**: What might the ATO want that isn't included?
- **Pre-emptive inclusion**: Adding likely-requested information upfront

**Common ATO requests for gambling PBRs**:
- Detailed bet logs for sample periods
- Bank statements showing betting transactions
- Screenshots of betting platforms and tools
- Explanation of betting methods and decision-making

#### Declaration Compliance
- **Applicant declaration**: Ensuring applicant understands what they're signing
- **Tax agent declaration**: Meeting professional obligations
- **Record retention**: Keeping evidence supporting all facts
