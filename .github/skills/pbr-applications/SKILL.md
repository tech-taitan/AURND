## Integration Principles

These skills are **not independent**—they operate as an integrated system:

1. **Legal Reasoning** requires **Subject Matter Expertise** to apply law to facts correctly
2. **Factual Investigation** feeds **Legal Reasoning** with the raw material for arguments
3. **Subject Matter Expertise** guides **Factual Investigation** by identifying what facts matter
4. **Professional Practice** enables all other skills to produce a compliant, polished output

## Workflow Integration

A typical PBR drafting workflow integrates skills as follows:

| Phase | Primary Skills | Supporting Skills |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Scoping** | Subject Matter Expertise | Legal Reasoning |

| **Research** | Legal Reasoning | Subject Matter Expertise |
| **Drafting** | Legal Reasoning, Factual Investigation | Professional Practice |
| **Review** | Professional Practice | All |
| **Lodgement** | Professional Practice | — |

## Competency Levels

Each sub-skill can be assessed at three levels:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Novice** | Understands concepts; requires supervision and templates |
| **Proficient** | Applies skills independently; handles standard matters |
| **Expert** | Handles complex/novel matters; can train others; develops precedents |

## Domain-Specific Modules
