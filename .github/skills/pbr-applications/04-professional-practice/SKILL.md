# Professional Practice & Production — Skill Definition

## Purpose

Enable the practitioner to efficiently produce, manage, and deliver high-quality PBR applications through professional document production, systematic workflows, rigorous quality assurance, and effective client communication.

## Why Combined

Document mechanics, project management, quality control, and client relations are all "operational excellence":

- **Production depends on workflow** — document creation follows process
- **Quality spans everything** — checking applies to documents and processes
- **Communication runs throughout** — not a separate final step
- **All support substantive work** — enabling, not replacing, legal/factual skills

This skill domain reflects the **operational competencies that make good work deliverable**.

## Level 2: Document Production

### Why Important

The ATO expects PBR applications in a specific format. Non-compliant documents:
- May be rejected or returned for correction

**Mandatory Sections** (in order):
1. Applicant Details
2. Tax Agent Details (if applicable)
3. Subject of Ruling
4. Questions
5. Period of Application
6. Relevant Facts and Circumstances
7. Relevant Legislative Provisions
8. Reasons in Support of Applicant's View
9. Applicant's View on the Ruling
10. Declaration
11. Attachments

**Formatting Requirements**:
- Clear headings for each section
- Numbered facts for cross-referencing
- Consistent citation format
- Declaration with signature blocks

#### Professional Formatting

## Level 2: Workflow Management

### Why Important

PBR applications involve:
- Multiple stakeholders (client, tax agent, lawyer, ATO)

#### Deadline Management

**Key Timeframes**:
- Client information gathering: Variable
- Drafting: 1-3 weeks typically
- Client review: 1-2 weeks
- ATO processing: 28-90 days typically
- Information request response: 28 days

**Tracking Systems**:
- Calendar integration
- Task management tools
- Reminder systems

#### Collaboration Protocols

**Stakeholder Roles**:
- Client: Provides facts, reviews drafts, signs declaration
- Tax Agent: Manages process, signs agent declaration
- Lawyer: Drafts application, advises on position
- ATO: Processes application, issues ruling

- Sign-off tracking

#### Version Control

**Document Versions**:
- Clear version numbering (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- Date stamps
- Track changes for revisions
- Clean final versions

**Fact Evolution**:
- Facts may change during drafting
- Tracking which version facts are current
- Updating arguments when facts change
- Audit trail for changes
