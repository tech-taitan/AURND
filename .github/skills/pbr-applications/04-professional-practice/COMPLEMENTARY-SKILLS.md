# Complementary Skills — Professional Practice & Production

## Overview

Professional Practice & Production enables the delivery of high-quality PBR applications. This document identifies skills that enhance, depend on, or integrate with this domain.

---

## Direct Dependencies

Skills that **depend on** Professional Practice for effective delivery:

### Legal Reasoning & Argumentation
**Location**: [../01-legal-reasoning/](../01-legal-reasoning/)

**Relationship**: Legal reasoning must be **delivered professionally**:
- Citation formatting requires document production skills
- Argument review requires QA processes
- Research management requires workflow systems

**Integration point**: QA processes catch citation errors; document production ensures proper formatting.

### Factual Investigation & Presentation
**Location**: [../02-factual-investigation/](../02-factual-investigation/)

**Relationship**: Fact-gathering requires **systematic processes**:
- Questionnaire systems for information gathering
- Document management for evidence
- Version control for evolving fact sets

**Integration point**: Workflow management coordinates the fact-gathering process.

### Subject Matter Expertise
**Location**: [../03-subject-matter-expertise/](../03-subject-matter-expertise/)

**Relationship**: Expertise requires **knowledge management**:
- Organising research materials
- Tracking precedent developments
- Maintaining reference libraries

**Integration point**: Professional Practice enables systematic knowledge maintenance.

## Enhancing Skills

Skills that **improve** Professional Practice:

### All Other Domains
**Relationship**: Professional Practice is enhanced by understanding what it supports:
- Understanding legal reasoning improves document structure decisions
- Understanding fact requirements improves questionnaire design
- Understanding subject matter improves QA focus areas

## Development Recommendations

### If Strong in Professional Practice, Develop:
1. **Substantive skills** — Legal Reasoning, Factual Investigation, Subject Matter Expertise
2. **Professional Practice enables but doesn't replace substantive competence**

### If Weak in Professional Practice, Strengthen Through:
1. **Checklists** — Systematic QA processes
2. **Templates** — Standardised documents
3. **Systems** — Project management tools
4. **Training** — Client communication skills
