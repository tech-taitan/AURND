# Professional Practice & Production

## Overview

This skill domain covers the operational competencies required to produce, manage, and deliver a PBR application—document production, workflow management, quality assurance, and client communication.

## Why This Skill Matters

Even excellent legal reasoning and thorough fact-gathering fail if:

- The document doesn't meet ATO format requirements
- Version control problems introduce errors
- Deadlines are missed
- Clients don't understand the process or outcome

**Poor professional practice** results in:
- Rejected applications for non-compliance
- Embarrassing errors that undermine credibility
- Missed deadlines and lost opportunities
- Client dissatisfaction despite good substantive work

## Scope

This skill domain encompasses:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Document Production** | Creating professional, compliant PBR documents |
| **Workflow Management** | Coordinating people, tasks, and deadlines |
| **Quality Assurance** | Verifying accuracy before lodgement |
| **Client Communication** | Managing expectations and relationships |

## Why Combined

Document mechanics and project management are both "getting the work done":

- Production and workflow are interdependent
- Quality assurance spans both
- Client communication runs throughout
- These are operational skills distinct from substantive legal/factual work

## Prerequisites

Before developing this skill, ensure foundational competency in:

- Word processing and document formatting
- Basic project management concepts
- Professional communication standards

## Learning Path

1. **Start** with Document Production — master the technical output
2. **Develop** Workflow Management — coordinate complex projects
3. **Build** Quality Assurance — systematic error prevention
4. **Refine** Client Communication — relationship management
