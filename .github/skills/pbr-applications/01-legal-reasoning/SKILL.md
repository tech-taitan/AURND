# Legal Reasoning & Argumentation — Skill Definition

## Purpose

Enable the practitioner to research, analyse, and present legal arguments that persuade the Commissioner to issue a favourable Private Binding Ruling.

## Why Combined

Legal research and legal writing are artificially separated in traditional curricula. In practice:

- You **research while writing** — drafting reveals gaps in your research
- You **write as you research** — capturing analysis as you find authorities
- Citation is **part of argument** — not a separate formatting task
- Strategy **pervades everything** — from which cases to cite to how to frame facts

This skill domain reflects the **integrated cognitive process** of legal analysis.

## Level 2: Legal Research

### Why Important

Every proposition in a PBR must be supported by authority. The Commissioner will:
- Apply authorities you haven't considered
- Distinguish cases you've cited poorly
- Rely on ATO rulings you haven't addressed

Comprehensive research is the foundation of credible argument.

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Case Law Research
- **Finding cases**: Using AustLII, LexisNexis, CCH to locate relevant decisions
- **Reading cases**: Identifying ratio decidendi vs obiter dicta
- **Extracting holdings**: Distilling the legal principle a case establishes
- **Synthesising case law**: Building a coherent framework from multiple decisions
- **Checking currency**: Ensuring cases haven't been overruled or distinguished

**Key cases for gambling PBRs**:
- *Brajkovich v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 1570 — six-factor test
- *Babka v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 1251 — system doesn't equal business
- *Evans v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 922 — scale not determinative

#### Statutory Interpretation
- **Navigating ITAA structure**: Understanding Parts, Divisions, Subdivisions
- **Definitions sections**: Applying s.995-1 definitions correctly
- **Extrinsic materials**: Using Explanatory Memoranda for ambiguous provisions
- **Purposive interpretation**: Understanding legislative intent

**Key provisions**:
- ITAA 1997 s.6-5 — ordinary income
- ITAA 1997 s.8-1 — general deductions
- ITAA 1997 s.995-1 — "business" definition
- TAA 1953 Part IVA — PBR administration

#### ATO Ruling Analysis
- **Taxation Rulings**: Binding public rulings on legal interpretation
- **Published PBRs**: Persuasive precedent showing ATO reasoning
- **Practice Statements**: Administrative guidance on procedures
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifying factors the ATO consistently applies

**Key ruling**: IT 2655 — betting and gambling as business

#### Database Navigation
- **ATO Legal Database**: Primary source for rulings and PBRs
- **AustLII**: Free case law and legislation
- **CCH iKnow**: Commercial research platform
- **LexisNexis AU**: Commercial research platform
- **Search techniques**: Boolean operators, field searches, citation searches

## Level 2: Argument Construction

### Why Important

Raw research must be transformed into **structured persuasion**. The Commissioner must be led logically from:
1. The legal framework → 
2. The relevant facts → 
3. The application of law to facts → 
4. The conclusion the applicant seeks

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Issue Framing
- **Precise questions**: Drafting questions the Commissioner can answer yes/no
- **Statutory linkage**: Tying each question to specific provisions
- **Scope limitation**: Avoiding questions that invite adverse rulings
- **Strategic sequencing**: Ordering questions to build toward desired outcome

**Example pattern**:
> Does the applicant's sports betting activity constitute carrying on a "business" within the meaning of section 995-1 of the ITAA 1997?

#### IRAC Methodology
- **Issue**: Clearly state the legal question
- **Rule**: Set out the applicable legal principles
- **Application**: Apply the rule to the specific facts
- **Conclusion**: State the answer to the issue

#### Counter-Argument Anticipation
- **Identifying weaknesses**: What facts hurt the position?
- **Pre-emptive rebuttal**: Addressing problems before the ATO raises them
- **Concession strategy**: When to concede minor points to strengthen main argument
- **Limiting adverse facts**: Explaining why unhelpful facts aren't determinative

#### Distinguishing Cases
- **Factual distinction**: Showing why an adverse case doesn't apply
- **Reasoning critique**: Challenging the basis of an adverse holding
- **Narrow reading**: Confining adverse cases to their specific facts
- **Hierarchy awareness**: Knowing which authorities trump others

**Example**: Distinguishing PBR 1052164226424 (the only business finding) by emphasising the applicant used **automated software**, unlike manual betting in the current case.

## Level 2: Legal Citation

### Why Important

Every legal proposition must be supported by authority. Incorrect citation:
- Undermines credibility
- Makes verification difficult
- Suggests lack of attention to detail

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### AGLC4 Case Citation
- **Format**: *Case Name* (Year) Volume Reporter Page
- **Pinpoint references**: *Brajkovich v FCT* (1989) 20 ATR 1570 at 1575
- **Parallel citations**: Providing alternative reporters
- **Subsequent history**: Noting appeals, overrulings

#### Legislation References
- **Format**: *Act Name Year* (Jurisdiction) section number
- **Subdivisions**: s.8-1(1)(a) — correct hierarchy
- **Definitions**: "business" as defined in s.995-1 of the ITAA 1997
- **Amendments**: Noting applicable version for ruling period

#### PBR/TR Citation
- **Taxation Rulings**: IT 2655, TR 2024/1
- **Private Binding Rulings**: PBR 1052164226424 (by reference number)
- **Practice Statements**: PS LA 2015/1

#### Footnote Technique
- **Authority hierarchy**: Cases over rulings over commentary
- **Signal usage**: "See", "Cf", "But see" for different relationships
- **Pinpoint references**: Specific paragraphs, not just case names
- **Multiple authorities**: Listing supporting sources

---

## Level 2: Strategic Positioning

### Why Important

A PBR application is **advocacy within bounds**. The applicant wants a favourable ruling but must:
- Not misrepresent facts or law
- Address contrary authorities honestly
- Present a defensible legal position

### Level 3 Sub-skills

#### Risk Assessment
- **Factor weighing**: How many factors favour the desired outcome?
- **Precedent comparison**: How similar is this case to favourable/adverse rulings?
- **Risk quantification**: Likelihood of favourable vs adverse ruling
- **Client counselling**: Advising on strength of position

#### Ethical Boundaries
- **Duty of candour**: Must not mislead the Commissioner
- **Fact omission**: When can unhelpful facts be omitted?
- **Arguable position**: Must have reasonable basis for view
- **Tax agent obligations**: Professional conduct requirements

#### Pre-emptive Rebuttal
- **Anticipating ATO concerns**: What will the ruling officer focus on?
- **Addressing in submissions**: Raising and answering concerns proactively
- **Strengthening weak points**: Providing additional evidence where needed

#### Aggressive vs Compliant Positioning
- **Aggressive**: Pushing boundaries of favourable interpretation
- **Compliant**: Accepting ATO's likely view
- **Calibrated**: Strongest defensible position
- **Client instructions**: Understanding risk appetite

## Practical Application

### Worked Example: Reasons Section Structure

From a gambling PBR application:

```markdown
## Reasons in Support of Applicant's View

### Legal Framework

The term "business" is defined in section 995-1 of the ITAA 1997 to include 
"any profession, trade, employment, vocation or calling, but does not include 
occupation as an employee."

Taxation Ruling IT 2655 provides guidance on when betting constitutes carrying 
on a business. The ruling identifies six factors...

[Citations to Brajkovich, Babka, Evans with pinpoint references]

### Application to Facts

#### Factor 1: Systematic, Organised and Businesslike Manner

The applicant's betting activities lack the hallmarks of business organisation:
- No business plan (Fact 45)
- No separate business bank account (Fact 42)
- No ABN registration (Fact 43)
- Manual, discretionary decision-making (Facts 28-31)

This contrasts with PBR 1052164226424, where the taxpayer used automated 
software that executed bets without human intervention...

### Conclusion

For the reasons above, the applicant's sports betting activities do not 
constitute carrying on a business within the meaning of section 995-1.
